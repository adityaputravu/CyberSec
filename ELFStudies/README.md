# ELF Studies
This is where I am going to keep all my tools that I develop while studying the structure of ELF file formats.

# ELF Segments

**elf64_parse_and_edit.py**

I developed this tool in order to parse elf segments and in order to extend and manipulate segment information.

# Full scale ELF manipulation

**DebuggerDisassemblerParserInC** is a larger project in **C** where I am building a debugger, a disassembler and header parser for ELF files.
